# D&D loading screen

Simple loading screen based on the well known reddit thread.

Dungeon Masters can't know everything and sometimes need to look things up. Inspired by [/u/CountedCrow](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/a059qp/oc_dd_5e_loading_screen_hints_definitive_edition/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) this loading screen / screensaver was made. You can put this on a screen at your D&D table to give your players something to talk about while you prepare the next encounter.
